<p>If \(G\) is a reductive group and \(M \subseteq G\) a Levi subgroup, e.g. for \(\GL_n\) a Levi is diagonal blocks of size \(n_1 + n_2 + \cdots +n_k = n\text{.}\) One can associate  a <a knowl="./knowl/def-cusp-form.html" title="Definition 1.40: Cusp forms">cusp form</a> to these subgroups following Eisenstein. There are automorphic \(L\)-functions corresponding to these and by doing the same procedure as last time we see these \(L\)-functions appearing in the constant terms of the Eisenstein series. So we can establish analytic properties of these automorphic \(L\)-functions via those of the Eisenstein series. This is known as the Langlands-Shahidi  method, it only works in some cases but when it does it is very powerful. Shahidi pushed the idea by looking at non-constant terms. In the example above we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{-2s}(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^{-2s} \prod(1+ 1/p^{2s} = \prod_{p|n} \zeta_p^{-1}(2s)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so there are \(L\)-functions even in the non-constant terms.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-aut-forms-motivation.html#remark-11">in-context</a></span>
