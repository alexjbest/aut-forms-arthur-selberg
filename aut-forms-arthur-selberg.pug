            Course overview:
            This course will be focused on the two papers #[url(href="http://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/zagier/files/scanned/EisensteinSelberg/fulltext.pdf") Eisenstein Series and the Selberg Trace Formula I] by D. Zagier and #[url(href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~hj/EisensteinTrace.pdf") Eisenstein series and the Selberg Trace Formula II] by H. Jacquet and D. Zagier. Although the titles of the papers sound like one is a prerequisite of the other it actually is not the case, the main difference is the language of the papers (the first is written in classical language whereas the second is written in adelically). We will spend most of our time with the second paper, which is adelic.

            proof
                title 1
                p

                p
                    | So #[m \sum_{n=1}^\infty \phi_n] converges absolutely.

                p
                    | One can push this idea to get analytic continuation to all of #[m \CC], one strip at a time.
                    | This is an analogue of the sharp cut off method mentioned above.
                    | It's fairly elementary but somewhat unmotivated and doesn't give any deep information (like the functional equation).

                    p
                        | These notions are different when we consider #[m \gamma \in G(\QQ)] something can be #[m \QQ]-elliptic but #[m \RR]-hyperbolic.

                p
                    | So we have
                    ul
                        li Parabolic #[m | \tr | = 2]
                        li Elliptic #[m | \tr | \lt 2]
                        li Hyperbolic #[m | \tr | \gt 2]
